  abstract = 	 {Gibbs measures are a fundamental class of distributions for the analysis of high dimensional data. Phase transitions, which are also known as degeneracy in the network science literature, are an emergent property of these models that well describe many physical systems. However, the reach of the Gibbs measure is now far outside the realm of physical systems, and in many of these domains multiphase behavior is a nuisance. This nuisance often makes distribution fitting impossible due to failure of the MCMC sampler, and even when an MLE fit is possible, if the solution is near a phase transition point, the plausibility of the fit can be highly questionable. We introduce a modification to the Gibbs distribution that reduces the effects of phase transitions, and with properly chosen hyper-parameters, provably removes all multiphase behavior. We show that this new distribution is just as easy to fit via MCMCMLE as the Gibbs measure, and provide examples in the Ising model from statistical physics and ERGMs from network science.}

Concepts and algorithms are demonstrated in five case studies involving up to 100 persons and up to eight types of tie, over as many as 15 time periods. In each case the model identifies a concrete social structure. Role and position concepts are then identified and interpreted in terms of these new models of concrete social structure. Part II, to be published in the May issue of this Journal (Boorman and White 1976), will show how the operational meaning of role structures in small populations can be generated from the sociometric blockmodels of Part I.},

Exponential random graph models are extremely difficult models to handle from a statistical viewpoint, since their normalising constant, which depends on model parameters, is available only in very trivial cases. We show how inference can be carried out in a Bayesian framework using a MCMC algorithm, which circumvents the need to calculate the normalising constants. We use a population MCMC approach which accelerates convergence and improves mixing of the Markov chain. This approach improves performance with respect to the Monte Carlo maximum likelihood method of Geyer and Thompson (1992)."

We establish theorems characterizing the propriety and existence of moments of the priors under various settings, examine asymptotic properties of the priors, and investigate the relationship to normal priors. Our approach is based on the notion of specifying a prior prediction y0 for the response vector of the current study, and a scalar precision parameter a0 which quantifies one's prior belief in y0. Then (y0,a0), along with the covariate matrix X of the current study, are used to specify the conjugate prior for the regression coefficients β in a generalized linear model. We examine properties of the prior for a0 fixed and for a0 random, and study elicitation strategies for (y0, a0) in detail. We also study generalized linear models with an unknown dispersion parameter. An example is given to demonstrate the properties of the prior and the resulting posterior.},

 abstract = {Maximum likelihood parameter estimation and sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions are problematic when the probability density for the parameter of interest involves an intractable normalising constant which is also a function of that parameter. In this paper, an auxiliary variable method is presented which requires only that independent samples can be drawn from the unnormalised density at any particular parameter value. The proposal distribution is constructed so that the normalising constant cancels from the Metropolis-Hastings ratio. The method is illustrated by producing posterior samples for parameters of the Ising model given a particular lattice realisation.},

abstract = "This paper describes an empirical comparison of four specifications of the exponential family of random graph models (ERGM), distinguished by model specification (dyadic independence, Markov, partial conditional dependence) and, for the Markov model, by estimation method (Maximum Pseudolikelihood, Maximum Likelihood). This was done by reanalyzing 102 student networks in 57 junior high school classes. At the level of all classes combined, earlier substantive conclusions were supported by all specifications. However, the different specifications led to different conclusions for individual classes. PL produced unreliable estimates (when ML is regarded as the standard) and had more convergence problems than ML. Furthermore, the estimates of covariate effects were affected considerably by controlling for network structure, although the precise specification of the structural part (Markov or partial conditional dependence) mattered less."

    abstract = { The development of stochastic models for the analysis of social networks is an important growth area in contemporary statistics. The last few decades have witnessed the rapid development of a variety of statistical models capable of representing the global structure of an observed network in terms of underlying generating mechanisms. The distinctive feature of statistical models for social networks is their ability to represent directly the dependence relations that these mechanisms entail. In this review, we focus on models for single network observations, particularly on the family of exponential random graph models. After defining the models, we discuss issues of model specification, estimation and assessment. We then review model extensions for the analysis of other types of network data, provide an empirical example, and give a selective overview of empirical studies that have adopted the basic model and its many variants. We conclude with an outline of the current analytical challenges. }

abstract = "This paper reviews, classifies and compares recent models for social networks that have mainly been published within the physics-oriented complex networks literature. The models fall into two categories: those in which the addition of new links is dependent on the (typically local) network structure (network evolution models, NEMs), and those in which links are generated based only on nodal attributes (nodal attribute models, NAMs). An exponential random graph model (ERGM) with structural dependencies is included for comparison. We fit models from each of these categories to two empirical acquaintance networks with respect to basic network properties. We compare higher order structures in the resulting networks with those in the data, with the aim of determining which models produce the most realistic network structure with respect to degree distributions, assortativity, clustering spectra, geodesic path distributions, and community structure (subgroups with dense internal connections). We find that the nodal attribute models successfully produce assortative networks and very clear community structure. However, they generate unrealistic clustering spectra and peaked degree distributions that do not match empirical data on large social networks. On the other hand, many of the network evolution models produce degree distributions and clustering spectra that agree more closely with data. They also generate assortative networks and community structure, although often not to the same extent as in the data. The ERGM model, which turned out to be near-degenerate in the parameter region best fitting our data, produces the weakest community structure."

We present a model of an online social movement, where actors exchange practical and symbolic resources through hyperlink and online frame networks. Our positioning of these exchanges within a continuum of conscious and unconscious expressive behavior informs our framework for the empirical analysis of online collectives. An application using data collected from the websites of over 160 environmental activist organizations reveals significant fragmentation in this field of contentious activity, which we suggest reflects offline social divisions."

abstract = {Summary Dependent phenomena, such as relational, spatial and temporal phenomena, tend to be characterized by local dependence in the sense that units which are close in a well-defined sense are dependent. In contrast with spatial and temporal phenomena, though, relational phenomena tend to lack a natural neighbourhood structure in the sense that it is unknown which units are close and thus dependent. Owing to the challenge of characterizing local dependence and constructing random graph models with local dependence, many conventional exponential family random graph models induce strong dependence and are not amenable to statistical inference. We take first steps to characterize local dependence in random graph models, inspired by the notion of finite neighbourhoods in spatial statistics and M-dependence in time series, and we show that local dependence endows random graph models with desirable properties which make them amenable to statistical inference. We show that random graph models with local dependence satisfy a natural domain consistency condition which every model should satisfy, but conventional exponential family random graph models do not satisfy. In addition, we establish a central limit theorem for random graph models with local dependence, which suggests that random graph models with local dependence are amenable to statistical inference. We discuss how random graph models with local dependence can be constructed by exploiting either observed or unobserved neighbourhood structure. In the absence of observed neighbourhood structure, we take a Bayesian view and express the uncertainty about the neighbourhood structure by specifying a prior on a set of suitable neighbourhood structures. We present simulation results and applications to two real world networks with ‘ground truth’.},

Phase transitions, which are also known as degeneracy in the network science literature, are an emergent property of these models that well describe many physical systems. However, the reach of the Gibbs measure is now far outside the realm of physical systems, and in many of these domains multiphase behavior is a nuisance. This nuisance often makes distribution fitting impossible due to failure of the MCMC sampler, and even when an MLE fit is possible, if the solution is near a phase transition point, the plausibility of the fit can be highly questionable. We introduce a modification to the Gibbs distribution that reduces the effects of phase transitions, and with properly chosen hyper-parameters, provably removes all multiphase behavior. We show that this new distribution is just as easy to fit via MCMCMLE as the Gibbs measure, and provide examples in the Ising model from statistical physics and ERGMs from network science.} }

@article{McLeveyetal2018,
	abstract = {Two fundamentally different perspectives on knowledge diffusion dominate debates about academic disciplines. On the one
hand, critics of disciplinary research and education have argued that disciplines are isolated silos, within which specialists pursue
inward-looking and increasingly narrow research agendas. On the other hand, critics of the silo argument have demonstrated that researchers
constantly import and export ideas across disciplinary boundaries. These perspectives have different implications for how knowledge diffuses,
how intellectuals gain and lose status within their disciplines, and how intellectual reputations evolve within and across disciplines. We
argue that highly general claims about the nature of disciplinary boundaries are counterproductive, and that research on the nature of specific
disciplinary boundaries is more useful. To that end, this paper uses a novel publication and citation network dataset and statistical models of
citation networks to test hypotheses about the boundaries between philosophy of science and 11 disciplinary clusters. Specifically, we test
hypotheses about whether engaging with and being cited by scientific communities outside philosophy of science has an impact on one's position
within philosophy of science. Our results suggest that philosophers of science produce interdisciplinary scholarship, but they tend not to cite
work by other philosophers when it is published in journals outside of their discipline. Furthermore, net of other factors, receiving citations
from other disciplines has no meaningful impact---positive or negative---on citations within philosophy of science. We conclude by considering
this evidence for simultaneous interdisciplinarity and insularity in terms of scientific trading theory and other work on disciplinary
boundaries and communication.},
