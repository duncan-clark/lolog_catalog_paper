Context

The statistical modeling of complex networks is hard. Most interesting social processes produce much more complex structure than models

Aim

We aim to develop models that are able to represent complex social network processes

Research Gap

Most models that are complex enough to represent networks are difficult to fit and/or interpret

Data

A representative ensemble of complex social networks from the journal "Social Networks"

Methods

We fit the recently proposed Latent Order Logistic models (LOLOG) to the networks and compare their fit to those of the original models

Key Findings

LOLOG generally produce similar or better fits and interpretations. LOLOGs are a fast, easy to use and useful modelling class
